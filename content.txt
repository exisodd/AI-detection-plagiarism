At the heart of Josef Von Sternberg's "Underworld" lies a ubiquitous theme: duplicity, friendship, betrayal. The film explores the dynamics of loyalty and trust between the Bull Weed, Rolls Royce Wensel through their relationship with Feathers McCoy.
For example, characterization is one literary device used to support this theme. The film is able to effectively portray the characters in a nuanced and complex manner, highlighting both the positive and negative traits of the characters. For example, Bull Weed is depicted as both a kind, charismatic friend, and a ruthless criminal boss. Similarly, Rolls Royce Wensel is depicted as both a loyal friend and a conflicted individual torn between his allegiance to Bull Weed and his relationship with Feathers. This gives the characters layers of depth and moral ambiguity. Through the actor's exaggerated emotional responses, the film is able to highlight the treachery and deceit that lies at the core of friendships.
My experience with a silent film like "Underworld" was great. Being used to movies filled with sound, this was a fresh new experience. The visual storytelling impressed me, as the film was able to convey its themes and emotions without sound. Despite the lack of speech or sound, I still understood the story and connected with the characters. I found myself having to pay much closer attention so as not to miss any important visual details conveyed throughout each scene such as body language, facial expressions, setting/background etc. In a certain way, this made it more engaging. Furthermore, the cinematography was impressive as well, with its use of light and shadows creating a moody atmosphere.
